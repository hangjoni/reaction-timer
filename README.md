## Learning notes

- This was initially developed using Vue CLI. To deploy, I decided to switch to using Vite to serve the app. [Followed this instruction](https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/how-to-migrate-from-vue-cli-to-vite/), the app is successfully deployed locally using Vite afterwards
- Hosted this app on Github pages following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo2bMGnIKE8). Key learning: the Vue project has to be in its own repo. Hosting via Github pages if the code for that Vue project is in a sub-folder of the repo .
